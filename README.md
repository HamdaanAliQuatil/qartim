# BB84 Quantum Key Distribution

A quantum key distibution based on the BB84 protocol which is a symmetric key distribution algorithm.
The protocol is provably secure based on two assumptions: the existence of an authenticated public classical channel and the quantum property that information gain is possible only if the two states one is trying to distinguish are not orthogonal, also known as the no-cloning theorem.
